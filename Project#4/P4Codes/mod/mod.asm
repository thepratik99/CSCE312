//This asm computes the modulo of two numbers
//Assuming R0 stores the number a and R1 stores the number b (b can not be 0)
//so in normal programming language, the goal is to compute RAM[R0]%RAM[R1]
//The result will be put to RAM[R2]
//Assuming RAM[R1] is positive integer and RAM[R0] is non-negative integer
//write your code here.
